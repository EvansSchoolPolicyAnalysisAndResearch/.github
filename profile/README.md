Established in 2008, the Evans School Policy Analysis and Research Group (EPAR) uses an innovative student-faculty team model to provide rigorous, applied research and analysis to international development stakeholders. EPAR has prepared more than 300 technical reports and briefs including: statistical data analysis and research, literature reviews and analysis, and portfolio analysis and strategy support. Our outputs focus on agriculture, development policy, financial services, poverty reduction, gender, and measurement and evaluation.

Go to our [main website](https://epar.evans.uw.edu/) to explore EPAR's research in sustainable, inclusive agriculture and rural livelihoods, household well-being and equity, and technology adoption under climate change.

On our GitHub site, we host code for processing data from the [LSMS-ISA](https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/lsms/initiatives/lsms-ISA), the [50X2030 initiative](https://www.50x2030.org/), and for developing apps for data in policy. Some highlights from our work are listed below:
